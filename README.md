# CoNLL-U Parser

 - The CoNLL-U format is a way to organize and analyze sentences in a structured table.
 - Each row in the table represents a word in the sentence.
 - Each columns provide information about a word, such as its part of speech (like noun or verb), its grammatical role, and how it connects to other words in the sentence.
 - Lines starting with # are comments

| **Column** | **Description**                                                                                      |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ID**     | The position of the word in the sentence, starting from 1. It helps identify the order of words.    |
| **FORM**   | The actual word as it appears in the text. For example, "cat" or "running."                        |
| **LEMMA**  | The base or dictionary form of the word. For instance, the lemma of "running" is "run."            |
| **UPOS**   | The universal part-of-speech tag that indicates the grammatical category of the word, such as NOUN (noun), VERB (verb), or ADJ (adjective). |
| **XPOS**   | The specific part-of-speech tag used in the original text or corpus, which might be more detailed or language-specific. |
| **FEATS**  | Additional grammatical features or attributes of the word, such as tense, number, or case. This provides extra details about the wordâ€™s role in the sentence and are delimited by the pipe sign `\|`.|
| **HEAD**   | The ID of the word that is the syntactic head of the current word. For example, in the phrase "the cat sleeps," "sleeps" would be the head of "cat." |
| **DEPREL** | The type of grammatical relationship between the word and its head. For example, "det" for determiner or "nsubj" for nominal subject. |
| **DEPS**   | (Optional) A list of additional dependencies, if there are multiple relations or connections.        |
| **MISC**   | (Optional) Any other miscellaneous information or notes about the word.                             |


Example:

```
# sent_id = 1
# text = The cat sleeps
1       The     the     DET     DT      Definite=Def|PronType=Art       2       det     _       _
2       cat     cat     NOUN    NN      Number=Sing     3       nsubj   _       _
3       sleeps  sleep   VERB    VBZ     Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Fin    0       ROOT    _       SpaceAfter=No
